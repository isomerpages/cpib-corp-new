<p>I was investigating Steven* for a corruption offence. Through my interviews
with him, I learnt that Steven had a young child who was suffering from
a serious medical condition and that his wife was unemployed. In the course
of the investigation, Steven passed away and knowing that the family was
in need of financial assistance, I offered to put the family in contact
with the relevant social services so that the family could continue to
receive the proper care and assistance. Steven’s wife was very grateful.
My story is not unique or special.</p>
<p><strong>The human touch –</strong> As investigators, our job at the Corrupt
Practices Investigation Bureau (CPIB) is to uncover the truth and ensure
that corrupt offenders are brought to task. However, the human touch is
also equally important. I joined the CPIB with a lofty ambition to eliminate
corruption. I did not expect to discover a human and softer side to the
Bureau amidst the noble mission.</p>
<p>The CPIB has a fearsome reputation, yet at the same time, it is not hesitant
to step in and help their fellow man when the occasion warrants it.</p>
