<p><strong>Chua Wee Yong</strong>
<br><strong>Principal Special Investigator</strong>
</p>
<p>While out with my wife at a shopping centre one weekend, I bumped into
Peter*. Peter was happy to see me, and told me that he was now doing well,
running a food business. I was glad for him. After that, we shook hands
and parted amicably. You might think that Peter was a long-lost friend
of mine. In fact, Peter was someone I had previously investigated and put
behind bars. My wife was very surprised that there was no trace of animosity
at all from Peter.</p>
<p><strong>Respect is earned.</strong> This is one key lesson Iâ€™ve learnt
in my experience as an investigator. During my interviews with Peter, I
took the time to understand and build rapport with him. Most importantly,
I treated him professionally and with respect, which eventually got him
to open up about his offence and led to the solving of the case.</p>
<p>Eventually, seeing people turn over a new leaf and rebuild their lives
honestly and for the better is very gratifying for me. Not many of us can
say this but I feel proud to have done my job to maintain a corruption-free
Singapore.</p>
