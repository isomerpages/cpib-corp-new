<summary>Is the giving of gifts on special or festive occasions considered corruption?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Broadly, corruption is receiving, asking for or giving any gratification
to induce a person to do a favour with a corrupt intent. Therefore, it
is not so straightforward without fully understanding the circumstances
of the case, the individual facts and the intent of the parties involved.
Each case must be assessed on its own merits to determine if it is a case
of corruption. The act of giving a genuine gift (such as red packets) in
itself without any corrupt intention is not considered corruption. However,
if the gift is given secretly, or in a manner that attempts to avoid notice
or attention with a view of securing personal special privilege or advantage
and more so at the expense of the recipient’s principal’s/employer’s interest
(i.e. resulting in a compromise of the recipient’s official duties), it
may be deemed to be corrupt and hence an offence under the Prevention of
Corruption Act. In giving gifts, especially if it involved parties whom
one may have an official relationship with, one may want to consider being
upfront with the recipient’s boss and employer. This would improve transparency
and at the same time allow the recipient’s employer to assess if the recipient
could be held beholden to the gifts.</p>

<summary>Are referral fees or commissions considered corruption?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>While there are no exhaustive guidelines as to when the payment or receipt
of referral fees is corrupt, much will depend on the individual facts and
circumstances of the case and the intent of the parties involved. For example,
whether such payments or receipts are properly accounted for, and whether
the receivers or the givers are allowed or authorised to accept or make
such payments either by their company or the regulatory bodies relating
to their profession.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Although it is not possible to list all instances where payment will be
deemed to be corrupt, the law has held that one of the elements that is
required to establish a corrupt transaction is that the transaction must
appear to the ordinary person to be “objectively corrupt”. Therefore, clear
instances of corruption would include instances where a “referral fee”
is given to an employee as an inducement or as a reward for gaining business
advantage and/or is intended to influence the employee to act in such a
way that compromises his employer’s interests. Each case must be assessed
on its own merits to determine if it is a case of corruption.</p>

<summary>If a Singaporean commits a corruption offence abroad, is he punishable
under the Prevention of Corruption Act?</summary>
<div data-type="detailsContent" class="isomer-details-content">
<p>Yes, the Act has extra-territorial powers over a Singapore citizen to
deal with corrupt acts outside Singapore as though it were committed in
Singapore. Non-citizens may be investigated and prosecuted in Singapore
