made a false statement in his corruption complaint.</p>
<p></p>
<p>PROTECTION OF INFORMERS (Section 36 of the Prevention of Corruption Act
1960):</p>
<p></p>
<p>1. Except as hereinafter provided, no complaints as to an offence under
this Act shall be admitted in evidence in any civil or criminal proceeding
whatsoever, and no witness shall be obliged or permitted to disclose the
name or address of any informer, or state any matter which might lead to
his discovery.</p>
<p>
<br>2. If any books, documents or papers which are in evidence or liable to
inspection in any civil or criminal proceeding whatsoever contain any entry
in which any informer is named or described or which might lead to his
discovery, the court before which the proceeding is had shall cause all
such passages to be concealed from view or to be obliterated so far as
is necessary to protect the informer from discovery, but no further.</p>
<p>
<br>3. If on a trial for any offence under this Act the court, after full
inquiry into the case, is of the opinion that the informer wilfully made
in his complaint a material statement which he knew or believed to be false
or did not believe to be true, or if in any other proceeding the court
is of the opinion that justice cannot be fully done between the parties
thereto without the discovery of the informer, the court may require the
production of the original complaint, if in writing, and permit inquiry
and require full disclosure concerning the informer.</p>
