<h3><strong>The CPIB Flag</strong></h3>
<p>The CPIB flag was commissioned in 2004 to further strengthen the Bureau’s
identity.</p>
<p>The design of the CPIB flag is a horizontal bi-colour of white above red,
with a CPIB logo emblazoned on the upper-left.</p>
<p>The upper white portion that carries the CPIB logo signifies the Bureau’s
high standard of integrity and our role in keeping Singapore clean and
corruption-free. The lower red portion represents CPIB’s role as a key
state institution.</p>

<h3><strong>The CPIB Logo</strong></h3>
<p><strong>The Square</strong> is symbolic of Fairness and Equality. The cascade
of the squares represents the pervasive effects of CPIB’s anti-corruption
action.</p>
<p><strong>The Red Globe</strong> represents the dot on top of the letter
“I” within the logo’s typography which stands for CPIB’s vigilance and
vision to be the world’s best anti-corruption agency.</p>
<p><strong>The State Colours of Red and White</strong> are chosen as a reminder
that combating corruption is an important national objective.</p>
