<p>Corruzione is a Web Game that leverages on gamification to educate on
the far-reaching consequences of corruption in a fun and interactive way.
Through a restaurant simulation setting, players will have to face challenges
and make decisions which emphasise the importance of honesty and integrity.
Corruzione was co-created with students from Nanyang Polytechnic’s School
of Design and Media.</p>
