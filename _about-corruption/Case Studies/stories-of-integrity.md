<p>No one is too young or too old to contribute in the fight against corruption.
Everyone has a part to play in ensuring that the venal does not take root
in our society.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On 27 January 2014, Muhammad Danial Bin Anwar, a Polytechnic student then,
encountered a young boy who was robbed of his handphone. The boy asked
Muhammad Danial Bin Anwar for help. The latter called the Police and the
two decided to follow the robber. Muhammad Danial Bin Anwar asked another
passer-by, then-Secondary School student Muhamad Danial Harith Bin Eaddy
(who coincidentally shared the same name) for help in apprehending the
robber.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The robber retaliated and attacked Muhamad Danial Harith when he tried
to stop him. The robber offered Muhamad Danial Harith S$20 as medical compensation
for hurting him but the offer was rejected. The robber then offered him
S$50 in exchange for not handing him over to the Police. Once again, Muhamad
Danial Harith rejected the offer. The robber managed to escape but he was
finally stopped by the youths again. He attempted to bribe Muhammad Danial
Bin Anwar this time with S$50 for his release before the Police arrived.
Muhammad Danial Bin Anwar rejected the offer.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The robber was subsequently subdued by the Police. The case was referred
by the Singapore Police Force to the CPIB. The accused was subsequently
charged and sentenced to 4 weeks’ imprisonment for corruption with effect
from 20 April 2015.</p>

assigned to conduct street walker rounds in the Geylang vicinity to detect
vice activities. As part of their rounds, both CID officers entered a lodging

<p>On 31 May 2015, Higher Customs Officer (HCO) Siow Teck Ming from Singapore
Customs encountered a female Chinese National who did not acquire a customs
permit for an equipment she brought into Singapore for an exhibition. After
HCO Siow Teck Ming advised her to engage a local declaring agent to obtain
the necessary permit, she asked HCO Siow in Mandarin if she could give
some money to solve the issue of not having a permit for the electronic
equipment. HCO Siow rejected her offer and warned her about her potential
action. She left the Singapore Customs Duty Office, only to return with
a bribe of US$200 placed between the pages of a telephone directory to
HCO Siow as an inducement for allowing the release of commercial goods
worth U$10,210/- without a permit. HCO Siow turned down the bribe offer.</p>
