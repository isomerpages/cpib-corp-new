<p>Dutch Marine Engineer, Cornelius Van der Horst was the Repair and Technical
Manager of Petroleum Shipping Ltd, a subsidiary of Exxon Corporation. Van
der Horst oversees the maintenance and repair of Exxon’s tankers worldwide,
including managing the tenders for contracts and making recommendations
to his senior management on which bids to accept.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Investigations revealed that in early 1990s, Keppel Shipyard’s marketing
manager first met Van der Horst in Holland to understand why Keppel had
been unsuccessful in obtaining contracts with Petroleum Shipping. In 1991,
they met again in Singapore together with another Keppel Shipyard senior
executive. Subsequently in 1992, a contract was awarded to Keppel Shipyard
by Petroleum Shipping. When the bill for the job was given, Van der Horst
had objected to the amount and referenced an earlier conversation he had
with the Keppel Shipyard executives. This information was then passed on
to other Keppel Directors, who after discussing the matter, decided to
give Van der Horst a cut of 1 per cent of the contract sum for all tenders
awarded to Keppel Shipyard by Petroleum Shipping. From January 1992 to
May 1995, a total of S$8,527,343.30 was remitted by Keppel Shipyard into
Van der Horst’s bank accounts held in Singapore so that the latter would
assist Keppel Shipyard in securing tenders for ship repair jobs with Petroleum
Shipping Ltd. This included providing information about Keppel Shipyard’s
competitors’ tenders, including the price and deadline to complete a job,
to Keppel Shipyard.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On 22 December 1997, Keppel Shipyard, who was represented in Court by
its financial controller, Wong Ngiam Jih, pleaded guilty to three charges
of corruption, and the company was fined a total of S$300,000. 14 other
charges against Keppel Shipyard were taken into consideration during sentencing.
Van der Horst had also pleaded guilty to corruption charges in a Southampton
court in 1996, and has been sentenced to three years’ imprisonment.</p>

<p>Getax Ocean Trades Pte Ltd (Getax Ocean), a Singapore incorporated company,
was the logistics arm of Getax Australia Pty Ltd (Getax Australia). The
company was in charge of chartering and arranging vessels for Getax Australia’s
phosphate shipments. Getax Australia’s core business at that time was the
export of phosphates from Togo and Nauru, and the import of the same to
India.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Investigations by the CPIB revealed that in January 2010, a Director at
Getax Australia had contacted Ryke Solomon, a Member of Parliament of the
Republic of Nauru, expressing his interest in advancing his company’s interest
with the Republic of Nauru Phosphate Corporation. Solomon subsequently
asked for at least USD$30,000 to fund his re-election campaign in Nauru.
On 18 February 2010, the same Director directed a manager at Getax Ocean
to transfer USD$20,000 from a Citibank account belonging to an agent of
Getax Ocean to the personal bank account of Solomon.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Getax Ocean was charged on 28 July 2016 with one count of corruptly giving
about USD$20,000 to Solomon as an inducement to advance the business interests
of Getax Australia with the Republic of Nauru. On 28 June 2018, Getax Ocean
Trades Pte Ltd was fined $80,000 for corruption.</p>

<p>Peh Chew Seng was the Deputy Director of Projects and Development at Tan
Tock Seng Hospital. He was in charge of the construction of a temporary
4-storey office next to the hospital’s main building.
<br>
</p>
<p>Investigations by the CPIB found that sometime in early 2009, Peh had
contacted his friend, Sim Geok Soon, an executive director of Trans Equatorial
Engineering Pte Ltd about the construction project. Peh had asked Sim if
his company would be keen to submit a tender for the project. Sim responded
that another affiliated company, PBT Engineering Pte Ltd, was interested
in the job. Through Sim, Peh was introduced to Phua Boon Kin, executive
director of PBT Engineering Pte Ltd. Prior to meeting Phua, Peh had told
Sim that if PBT Engineering was successful in tendering for the project,
he expected something in return. Sim then informed Phua of Peh’s request
for the commission, to which Phua agreed. Peh’s misdeeds eventually came
to light when he contacted the building project consultant to disqualify
the three lowest bids from running for the tender and to put PBT Engineering
Pte Ltd through to the next round of assessment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Peh Chew Seng was found guilty of corruption by the Court and was sentenced
to six weeks imprisonment on 12 September 2012.</p>

<p>Goh Peng Choy was a Senior Procurement Executive with Advanced Material
Engineering Pte Ltd (AME), a wholly owned subsidiary of ST Kinetics Ltd.
He had abused his position to obtain bribes from several contractors of
AME in return for divulging AME’s internal price list which is confidential
information or showing favour to the contractors. All the bribe monies
were given in cash to Goh Peng Choy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Goh Peng Choy had concealed the bribe monies with the assistance of his
brother, Goh Peng Kee. The latter had hidden the cash in his residence.
Goh Peng Choy had also instructed his brother and sister-in-law to open
bank accounts to deposit part of bribe monies. S$385,000 was found in Goh
Peng Kee’s safe. A further S$100,767.03 was recovered from the bank accounts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Goh Peng Choy was subsequently charged for both corruption and money laundering
offences. On 17 February 2014, he pleaded guilty to 4 corruption charges
and one money laundering offence and was sentenced to 22 months’ imprisonment.
The Judge also ordered him to pay a penalty of S$372,923 while S$12,077
was forfeited to the State. A total of S$485,767.03 was recovered.</p>

<p>Teh Hang Peng was a Material Controller with the Singapore Technologies
Logistics Pte Ltd (ST Log) and was based at the warehouse in Tuas Naval
Base (TNB), Republic of Singapore Navy (RSN). His duties as a Material
Controller were to check that the goods delivered to the Tuas Naval Base
are of the correct description and quantity based on the Purchase Orders
and Delivery Orders as required by the Republic of Singapore Navy. From
January 2003 to July 2004, Teh was found to have obtained a total of S$9,300
in return for assisting Lim Teck Beng, then the manager of JP Marine (SEA)
Pte Ltd, to supply locally fabricated marine spare parts to TNB and passing
them off as imported originals.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPIB started investigating the case after it had received information.
Its investigation revealed that Teh had given assistance to Lim in various
ways. Teh had smuggled existing stock from the TNB warehouse and passed
the parts to Lim. Lim subsequently brought these “samples” to the fabricators
and fabricated similar ones that were disguised as those produced by the
Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) before supplying to the RSN. He
then checked the part numbers, origins and functions at the warehouse and
subsequently passed the information to Lim. Teh had also removed packing
labels and sticker from existing stock in the warehouse, together with
the description on how the items were normally packed by the OEM overseas,
and passed them over to Lim to reproduce. In addition, Teh had informed
Lim of the work schedule of the Quality Assistance (QA) Inspectors. Lim
needed the information as he would prefer to deliver the fabricated parts
to the TNB warehouse at those times when the known meticulous QA Inspectors
were off duty.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Teh Hang Peng was consequently fined S$60,000 and ordered to pay a penalty*
of S$9,300 in November 2004 for corruption offences. Lim, on the other
hand was fined S$72,000.</p>
<p></p>

<p>Chua Kim Guan was a Managing Director of Jin Li Mould Manufacturing Pte
Ltd and was in charge of the operations in the company. Ang Kok Kiat was
the Sales Director of the same company. The company is in the business
of producing moulds and has had business dealings with Apple Inc since
2001.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPIB received information on the case and investigation had shown
that between November 2006 to June 2009, the duo had worked together to
give bribes to one Paul Shin Devine, a Global Supply Manager under the
employment of Apple Inc. In return, Devine would provide information on
Apple Inc’s upcoming projects such as product forecasts and pricing targets
so that Jin Li Mould Manufacturing Pte Ltd could secure the contracts.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Chua had allegedly given a total of US$387,600 to Devine over a course
of 2 years in Singapore, Macau, People’s Republic of China (PRC) and the
United States of America (USA) to advance Jin Li Mould Manufacturing Pte
Ltd’s business interests. Ang had abetted these transactions as well as
those involving two other Singaporean companies, Fastening Technology Pte
Ltd and Lateral Solutions Pte Ltd. Moreover, he had also received payments
from the shareholders of the two companies, for aiding them to secure business
contracts from Apple Inc through Devine. He also received from Devine for
his assistance in the transactions with Jin Li Mould Manufacturing Pte
Ltd, Fastening Technology Pte Ltd and Lateral Solutions Pte Ltd.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In December 2013, Chua Kim Guan was jailed for 9 months for giving bribes
to Paul Shin Devine to advance his company’s business interests with Apple
Inc. Ang Kok Kiat was sentenced to imprisonment of 12 months and ordered
to pay a penalty* of S$281,985.51. Paul Shin Devine had pleaded guilty
earlier in the US Federal Court in February 2011 to wire fraud, conspiracy
and money laundering.</p>

<p>Leng Kah Poh was the IKEA Food Service Manager for Ikano Pte Ltd (IKEA
Singapore). Being the top man in charge of IKEA Food Service, he had a
free hand in making most of the decisions related to the restaurant operations
including approving food suppliers to IKEA Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPIB received information on the case and its investigation revealed
that sometime in 2002, Leng got acquainted with Lim Kim Seng, the sole
proprietor of Buildcare Services who performed cleaning works for IKEA
Singapore’s restaurants. The latter approached Leng with a business proposal
to replace IKEA Singapore’s existing food supplier. He introduced Tee Fook
Boon, the sole proprietor of AT35 to Leng. Subsequently, AT35 managed to
take over the supply of raw food ingredients from IKEA Singapore’s existing
supplier with the assistance and recommendation of Leng. Part of the company
(AT35)’s profits went to Leng even though he did not contribute to the
initial capital investment to finance their business scheme. Later, Lim
set up Food Royale Trading (FRT) to supply chilled and dry food products
to IKEA Singapore. AT35 and FRT then became the exclusive suppliers of
frozen, chilled and dried food ingredients and products to IKEA Singapore.
Leng continued to exercise his influence and favour the two companies.
He would give insider information on how to make AT35’s and FRT’s products
attractive to IKEA Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Over a period of about 7 years, through AT35 and FRT, Lim Kim Seng, Tee
Fook Boon and Leng Kah Poh amassed for themselves S$6.9 million out of
the company profits from the food supply contracts with IKEA Singapore.
Leng took a one-third share for his pivotal role in their business scheme,
in the amount of about S$2.3 million.</p>
<p></p>
<p>All 3 persons were charged and convicted for corruption offences. Leng
Kah Poh was convicted by a District Court in July 2013 but was later acquitted
in September 2013 by the High Court. The High Court decision was then overturned
by the Court of Appeal in November 2014, which restored Leng’s original
sentence of 98 weeks imprisonment and S$2,341,508 penalty* on the corrupt
proceeds he received. Lim Kim Seng was convicted and sentenced to 70 weeks
imprisonment in 2013. Tee Fook Boon was originally convicted by a District
Court to 16 weeks imprisonment and fine of S$180,000. Subsequently, Tee’s
imprisonment was enhanced to 40 weeks with the fine amount remaining unchanged
on 22 August 2011.</p>

<p>Tay Ee Tiong is the owner of Wealthy Seafood Product and Enterprise. During
his course of work, he had personally approached each head chef and promised
them commissions in return for showing favour to Wealthy Seafood. Many
of these chefs were from well-known Chinese restaurants and hotels in Singapore.
These chefs were prominent and established, and had the authority to make
decisions on the choice of suppliers for their respective restaurants.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPIB’s investigations found out that from February 2006 and August
2009, Tay had given bribes to 19 chefs ranging from S$200 and S$24,000.
Tay would approach these chefs and promise them commissions, based on a
percentage of the total value of the seafood products bought. The chefs
would receive the cash from Tay once every two to three months. In return,
they would continue to place their seafood orders from Tay’s company.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Tay Ee Tiong was eventually charged with 223 counts of corruption and
sentenced to 18 months’ imprisonment in September 2011 for giving out nearly
S$1 million in bribes. The chefs involved were also convicted with corruptly
accepting bribes from Tay and received their respective sentences, with
the exception of one who was acquitted.</p>

<p>Antonov Sergey was the Chief Engineer of the vessel MT Front Splendour
while Choo Soo Beng was a Cargo Officer with Sea Hub Energy Pte Ltd assigned
to the bunker barge MT Ivory. These individuals ensured that MT Ivory delivered
a shortfall of marine fuel to the vessel - MT Front Splendor. The vessel
had received less fuel than the amount of 2,662.389 metric tonnes as stated
in the documents. The intent of this endeavour was to enable the buying
back of the extra fuel. Sergey’s ship, the MT Front Splendour, had ordered
marine fuel from supplier Sea Hub Energy to be supplied on 20 January 2013.
However, Choo had struck a deal with Sergey to accept a short delivery
of marine fuel in return for a bribe of US$8,400.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Lam Tat Fei, colleague of Choo and a boatman under the employment of Sea
Hub Energy, received US$200 from Choo for his part in the transaction.
Lam was responsible for obtaining confirmation to proceed with the deal,
and for delivering the amount of US$18,000 to pay for the extra fuel resulting
from the shortfall. An independent bunker surveyor working for Saybolt
Singapore Pte Ltd, Loh Tuck Seng, was also bribed to provide false declaration
that 2,662.389 tonnes of fuel had been received by MT Front Splendour from
MT Ivory, instead of the actual 2,542 tonnes delivered. Loh received US$400
and US$5,500 from Sergey and Choo respectively. To account for the extra
fuel on board MT Ivory, Choo falsified a barge transfer advice and the
stock movement logbook to indicate a bogus transfer of fuel from another
vessel, MT Hai Soon X, to the MT Ivory.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPIB started its investigation after it had received information on
the case.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The four men were charged for their part in the illegal “buyback” transaction
which constituted a corruption offence. Antonov Sergey was sentenced to
2 weeks’ jail, fined S$30,000 and ordered by the Court to pay a penalty*
of US$6,750 which was the amount not recovered. Choo Soo Beng was jailed
for 8 weeks while Loh Tuck Seng was jailed for 2 weeks and fined S$25,000.
Lam Tat Fei was sentenced to 6 weeks in prison and ordered to pay a penalty*
of US$200. The amounts of US$3,900, US$5,900 and US$1,250 were seized from
Choo Soo Beng, Loh Tuck Seng and Antonov Sergey respectively and these
were forfeited to the state.</p>

<p>On 10 April 2012, GUFC goalkeeper Mohamed Yazid Mohamed Yasin received
a call from an unidentified foreign number. The male caller, who sounded
Korean, asked Yazid if he was willing to fix the results of matches he

S$7,000. Kim met Yazid on 2 May 2013 where he gave Yazid S$4,000 as an
inducement to ensure that the GUFC lost its match against Harimau Muda
A Football Club that was to be played on 3 May 2012. Another S$4,000 was
given to Yazid to be passed to another football player of GUFC to fix the
same S-League football match. Yazid rejected the bribe offer. Subsequently,

<p>Wong Teck Long was former Senior Vice-President (Private Banking) of Bayerische
Landesbank Girozentrale (BLG). Part of his duties at BLG was to source
for private individuals in the Asia Pacific region who wished to borrow
money for investments.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPIB had received information on the case. Its investigation revealed
that Wong was introduced to Kong Kok Keong who was then Executive Director
of Innosabah Sdn Bhd (Innosabah), a share broking company located in Sabah,
Malaysia. Kong had intended to obtain credit facility from BLG to purchase
shares. Subsequently, in April 1997, Wong put up a Credit Approval to the
management of BLG recommending to grant Kong a Revolving Short-Term Multi-Currency
Loan of RM14.5 million. The management approved the loan application. Kong,
besides obtaining the loan from BLG for himself, also got his nominees
from Malaysia to apply for the loans. Nine Malaysians managed to obtain
Revolving Short-Term Multi-Currency Loan of RM14.5 million each from BLG
through Wong.</p>
<p></p>
<p>For expediting the approval and drawdown of the loans, Wong demanded a
substantial commission from Kong. The commission was given to Wong in the
form of shares traded in Wong’s nominee share account with Innosabah. Wong
would purchase the shares but the shares would be paid by Kong. In total,
Wong had received from Kong about RM 300,000 to RM 400,000 which were the
proceeds from the sales of shares.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In February 2005, Wong Teck Long was sentenced to 4 months imprisonment
and ordered to pay a penalty* of S$150,000 for corruption offences. In
June 2005, Wong appealed against the sentence without success. Instead,
his sentence was increased from 4 months to 15 months imprisonment. The
penalty sum remained at S$150,000.</p>

His responsibilities included overseeing the daily loading and unloading
operation of passenger baggage for incoming and outgoing flights from Changi
Airport Terminal 2.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPIB started an investigation on the case after it had received information.
Between 6 November 2007 and 29 April 2008, Rahim had accepted gratifications
totalling S$5,080 from one Abdul Falik Bin Abdul Latiff, a freelance airport
agent in return for confidential information of passengers with no check-in
baggage. Falik had used the information to help his clients who are foreign
passengers with excess baggage. The excess baggage were then included under
the quota meant for those passengers without any check-in baggage so that
Falik’s clients did not have to pay the excess baggage charges.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Rahim had made unauthorized access into the Kris Check system (used at
Changi Airport) on 25 occasions from 5 November 2007 to 25 April 2008,
to obtain the names and information of passengers (with no check-in baggage)
for Falik. Falik would get paid for providing this service and he, in turn,
would pay Rahim for providing him with the list of passenger names.</p>

<p>Singleton Marc Alexander was the former Managing Director of Performance
Motors Ltd. As Managing Director, part of his responsibilities was to review
the yearly renewal of authorised dealership granted to local companies
for the distribution and sales for BMW cars in Singapore. He also had the
authority to approve or terminate dealerships.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPIB had received information on the case. Its investigation revealed
that on 17 December 1999, Alexander received two Rolex watches from Teo
Kian Hong, a Director of Teo Tian Seng Motor Credit Pte Ltd (TTS), as a
Christmas present. In return, Teo had hoped that Alexander would continue
to appoint TTS as one of the dealers for distributing BMW cars. Subsequently,
Alexander had approached Teo with requests to buy more branded watches.
On some occasions, Alexander would make a payment to Teo for the branded
watches at a discounted price. But most of the time, Alexander would not
pay back Teo for the branded watches. Teo did not seek payment from Alexander
as she wanted TTS to continue to be an authorized dealer for BMW cars.
The branded watches had a total worth of more than S$100,000. Alexander
also obtained from Teo, 3 Nokia handphones and a sum of S$78,000.</p>

<p>Besides Alexander, Teo had also given bribes to Patrick Pow, the Director
of Sales and Marketing at Performance Motors Ltd. In his position, Pow
could recommend for renewal or termination of dealer agreements. Teo had
given Pow a Hermes watch as a Christmas gift. Despite Pow knowing it was
against company policy, he accepted the gift. From December 2000 to December
2002, Pow obtained from Teo branded watches with a total worth of S$4,165,
a Nokia handphone worth S$1,388 and a loan of S$60,000.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Further investigation revealed that Pow has also obtained bribes from
Kheh Thiam Hoo, Director of Skyway Credit &amp; Leasing Pte Ltd (Performance
Motors Ltd’s appointed sole finance agent), in return for the maintenance
of a good business relationship with Skyway. Pow had received from Kheh,
a Frank Muller watch worth S$13,390 for his birthday and loans amounting
to S$82,000.</p>
