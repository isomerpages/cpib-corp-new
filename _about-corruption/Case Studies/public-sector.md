<p>Phey Yew Kok was a prominent unionist in Singapore during the 1970s. Not
only was he the president of the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC)
and former Member of Parliament for Boon Teck constituency, he was also
the General Secretary of the Singapore Industrial Labour Organisation (SILO)
and General Secretary of the Pioneer Industries Employees’ Union (PIEU).</p>
<p></p>
<p>However, his illustrious career ended in 1979 when he was investigated
by the CPIB for malpractices in the PIEU and SILO. On 10 December 1979,
Phey was formally charged with four counts of Criminal Breach of Trust
involving a total of S$82,520, and other offences under the Trade Unions
Act (Cap 129). He was released on bail but failed to turn up for his further
Court mention on 7 January 1980. A Warrant of Arrest was subsequently issued
against him on the same day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Investigations eventually revealed that Phey had fled Singapore on 31
December 1979. 35 years on, Phey surrendered himself at the Singapore Embassy
in Bangkok on 22 June 2015. On 23 June 2015, CPIB officers accompanied
Phey back to Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On 23 July 2015, Phey was slapped with 28 additional charges bringing
his total number of charges to 34. He was alleged to have misappropriated
more than S$350,000 over roughly six-and-a-half years in the 1970s, mostly
from SILO and PIEU. The charges also accused Phey of instigating an accountant
to provide false information to a CPIB officer and fabricating false evidence.
He also faced a charge for jumping bail in 1979.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The long running case finally concluded on 22 January 2016 when Phey Yew
Kok pleaded guilty to 12 of the 34 charges, including 10 counts of criminal
breach of trust involving S$243,878. Phey was sentenced to 60 months’ imprisonment.
The other 22 charges were taken into consideration in sentencing him.</p>

<p>Lai Wai Khuen was an assistant director at the Media Development Authority
(MDA). His work responsibilities included the evaluation of projects under
those companies he liaised with to determine if they fit the criteria for
the application of various MDA grants before asking the companies to send
in their applications. Upon receiving the applications, Lai would then
forward them to a panel of assessors who would assess on the application
and decide whether to approve the grant. Lai was also responsible for the
disbursement of the approved grant which was usually given out according
to the project milestones reached.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Acting on information received, the CPIB’s investigation found out that
from 2010 to 2013, Lai had obtained loans from the grant applicants as
an inducement or reward for facilitating the approval and disbursement
of the grants. In total, he had obtained loans from 12 individuals on 27
occasions and another occasion where he had attempted to obtain a loan
of S$3,000 unsuccessfully.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In addition, on three separate occasions, Lai had forged internal documents
for grant approval by fraudulently signing off as a Director with the MDA,
with the intention to mislead that the document was signed by the latter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On 17 January 2014, Lai Wai Khuen was charged for corruptly obtaining
loans and corruptly attempting to obtain a loan as an inducement for facilitating
the approval and disbursement of grants. He was also charged for forging
documents. Eventually, he was sentenced to 14 months’ jail and was ordered
to pay a penalty* of $18,000 in July 2014.</p>
<p></p>
<p>* Penalty is an additional punishment (for corruption offences) imposed
on the bribe taker to pay a sum which is equal to the amount of that gratification.</p>

<p>Norezwan Bin Em was a former Senior Investigation Officer in the Employment
Inspectorate of the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). The department focuses
on illegal employment, illegal deployment and other violations of MOM’s
foreign manpower regulations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The CPIB had received information on the case. Its investigation revealed
that in October 2012, Norezwan issued a Special Pass to a female Chinese
National who was assisting MOM with an investigation. With the special
pass, she was allowed to stay in Singapore legally. Norezwan continued
to contact her in his personal capacity. On three occasions, between 30
October 2012 and 6 November 2012, he had obtained sexual favours from her
at a park in Clementi and Oxley Hotel 88, as an inducement for the extension
of her stay in Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>On 19 September 2013, Norezwan Bin Em was convicted for corruptly obtaining
gratification in the form of sexual favours. He was sentenced to 8 months’
jail for corruption in October 2013.</p>

<p>Choy Hon Tim was former Deputy Chief Executive (Operations) of the Public
Utilities Board (PUB). He had been bribed by a businessman who was once
employed at PUB as a clerk. Choy’s relationship with the businessman developed
in 1974 when the latter became a sub-contractor to PUB. It started in 1977,
when the businessman sought the assistance of Choy who was then a PUB engineer,
to ensure the smooth laying of high-tension cables in his sub-contract
works with PUB. In return, Choy was given 20 per cent of the company’s
profits in cash. This arrangement lasted up until the businessman shut
down his sub-contracting company and migrated to Australia.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1983, the businessman approached Choy again, who was then the Acting
Chief Electrical Engineer, to set up a ‘consultancy service’, providing
advice to international contractors interested in doing business with PUB.
The role of the businessman was to provide consultancy services to prospective
contractors while Choy provided confidential and privileged information
concerning PUB tenders. He was also to provide assistance wherever necessary
to ensure the smooth running of projects after they were awarded to the
contractors.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This lucrative partnership earned the businessman a total of S$63,377,744
and of this sum, S$12,240,613 went to Choy. The payments were made via
cheques or cash orders payable to Choy’s former and second wives.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The case was opened for investigation by the CPIB in 1994, and with the
help of Hong Kong’s Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC). According
to CPIB’s investigation, Choy had as much as S$13 million stashed in a
Hong Kong bank account under his second wife’s sister’s name. As his sister-in-law
was not a high-earning individual, there was no way she could have accumulated
that amount of money.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Choy Hon Tim soon fled the country. He was eventually brought back to
face legal action in Singapore. On 27 October 1995, Choy Hon Tim was charged
in court for criminal conspiracy and accepting bribes totalling around
S$13.85 million, and was sentenced to prison for 14 years. To date, the
total amount of bribes he had received remains the largest total amount
of bribe monies involved in Singapore’s history.</p>

<p>Mohamed Yusof Bin Abdul Rahman, former Singapore Customs officer, was
deployed at the GST Refund Inspection Counter in the airport during the
offence period between January 2013 and January 2014. His duty was to process
the GST refund claims made by tourists leaving Singapore.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Investigations by the CPIB, the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore
(IRAS) and the Singapore Customs had in late 2013 revealed that a group
of accomplices had made fraudulent GST refund claims under the electronic
tourist refund scheme (eTRS). On various occasions, Yusof assisted four
Indian nationals to fraudulently claim a total of S$493,858.67 in GST refunds.</p>
<p></p>
<p>As part of their illegal scheme, the four Indian nationals paid for receipts
from bona fide shoppers who had purchased jewellery and obtained eTRS tickets
from the jewellery retailers. They would then present to Yusof, the eTRS
tickets and jewellery to support their eTRS claims. Yusof then helped to
approve their GST refund claims even though the jewellery produced did
not match the goods description on the receipts. In return, Yusof accepted
bribes in cash. The total amount of cash bribes that Yusof had received
from them amounted to S$11,400.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Mohamed Yusof Bin Abdul Rahman was charged for both corruption and GST
tax evasion. The corruption charges involved a total amount of S$3,350
and the GST tax evasion charges involved a total amount of S$220,561.60.
In February 2015, the court sentenced Yusof to 5 years’ jail, and ordered
to pay a total penalty* of S$673,084.80 for corruption and abetting four
Indian nationals to fraudulently claim GST tourist refund.</p>

<p>Marzuki Bin Ahmad was an ex-Assistant Property Executive of Jurong Town
Corporation. He was tasked to conduct periodic checks and inspections at
premises leased out by JTC to ensure that the lessees complied with applicable
local laws and regulations as well as with the terms of their leases, and
was obliged to report any such infringements.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marzuki conducted inspections at dormitories for foreign workers at a
number of JTC-owned premises which were managed by Chew Wee Kiang. Marzuki
discovered that foreign workers were being housed at the premises even
though certain approvals from the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the
Singapore Civil Defence Force had yet to be obtained at that time. CPIB’s
investigation showed that Marzuki told Chew that he was in need of money.
They subsequently came to an understanding that Marzuki would not report
the non-compliance that he had discovered in exchange for some loans that
Chew would extend to him. Over a period of more than a year, Marzuki received
S$31,500 by way of loans from Chew and attempted to obtain a further loan
of S$5,000 from the latter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Marzuki Bin Ahmad was convicted and sentenced to a total of 8 month’s
imprisonment and a penalty* of S$11,500 in May 2014 for corruption offences.</p>

<p></p>
<p>CPIB’s investigations revealed that was introduced at a drinking session
to Tan Chuan Hee, a drug offender who was arrested by the CNB and subsequently

Tan was released from the DRC in early 1997, but was placed on supervision
order for two years and had to report to the CNB “G” Supervision Division
at Bedok Police Station for urine tests periodically. As Tan continued
to consume heroin during this period, he was afraid that his urine would
be tested positive. Yong suggested to Tan that he could help him to shorten
his supervision period if he was willing to spend money. Yong accepted
S$1,000 on two occasions and also entertainment from Tan. Tan’s supervision
order was subsequently shortened from 2 years to 16 months.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In 1998, Tan was arrested by the CNB for consumption of drugs. He was
placed on a bail of $5,000, and upon release, he decided to abscond and
jump bail. Yong informed Tan that he was wanted for jumping bail, and that
he could help him settle his case in return for S$1,000. Tan agreed and
gave Cpl Yong the S$1,000 and also paid for his entertainment. Cpl Yong
continued to accept gratification in the form of bribe monies and entertainment
from Tan on several more occasions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Yong Swee Fatt was charged and convicted for corruption and a Penal Code
offence. He was sentenced to a total of 27 months’ imprisonment in August
