<p>Corruption in Singapore is under control. However, a clean system is not
a natural state of affairs. Corruption comes from weakness of human nature
– greed, temptation, the desire to amass wealth or to obtain business through
unfair means. Even with harsh penalties, corruption cannot be eradicated
completely.</p>
<p>Below are some measures businesses and organisations can adopt to help
prevent corruption in the work-place.</p>
<h3><strong>Clear Business Processes</strong></h3>
<p>Having defined workflows, clear directives on financial approving authorities,
and standard procurement instructions can help flag irregularities in a
business or organisation. These processes should be reviewed on regular
basis to ensure they are updated to the shifting business environment.
Diligent record-keeping and regular audits are also good practices to deter
corrupt activities.</p>
<h3><strong>Policy on Gifts and Entertainment</strong></h3>
<p>Gifts and entertainment are often offered in the legitimate course of
business to promote good relations. However, if it is too frequent or lavish,
or done with the deliberate intention to gain an unfair business advantage,
such gifts and entertainment can be tantamount to corruption, regardless
of whether the recipient is able to fulfil the request of the giver. The
risk of corruption can be reduced by setting a policy on when gifts and
entertainment may be given and accepted and what records need to be kept.
Your business partners should be aware of your organisation’s gift and
entertainment policy too.</p>
<h3><strong>Declaration of Conflict of Interest</strong></h3>
<p>Conflict of interest occur when a personal interest or relationships is
placed before the business interest, and can lead to corrupt activities
such as giving or accepting bribes. In order to safeguard the business
interest, a declaration system that is applicable to all levels of employees
may be instituted. The company may provide a declaration form for conflict
of interest for employees, and then use the information to take the most
appropriate course of action. This could include excluding the employee
from engaging in the work or transferring the employee to another department
or post.</p>
<h3><strong>Convenient Corruption Reporting System</strong></h3>
<p>The corruption reporting system is a key function to control corruption
and bribery risks, and can comprise a whistle-blowing policy or feedback
channel where staff can conveniently raise concerns and feel protected
from being identified or retaliated against. One way to do this would be
by allowing reports to be filed anonymously through a publicised email
address or phone number.</p>
