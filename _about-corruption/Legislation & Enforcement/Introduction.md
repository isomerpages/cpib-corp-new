<p>Singapore adopts a zero-tolerance approach towards corruption, and the
CPIB will not hesitate to bring corrupt offenders to Court, irrespective
of status, creed or rank. Since independence, the Government was determined
to take all necessary legislative measures to reduce the opportunities
of corruption, and to deter and punish severely corrupt offenders.</p>
<p>The Prevention of Corruption Act 1960 (PCA) is the primary anti-corruption
legislation in Singapore, and forms one of the key pillars in Singaporeâ€™s
fight against corruption. The PCA 1960 provides the CPIB the powers to
investigate corruption and other arrestable offences which are disclosed
in the course of corruption investigation. Under the PCA 1960, CPIB officers
are also empowered to arrest, conduct a premise search or seize evidence
without warrant if there is credible information or reasonable suspicion
that a corruption offence has been committed.</p>
<p>The Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation
of Benefits) Act 1992 (CDSA) works in tandem with the PCA 1960 by punishing
the laundering of bribe money. The CDSA 1992 provides for the State to
confiscate corrupt benefits.</p>
<p>The Penal Code (Sections 161 to 165) also contains provisions that deal
specifically with the bribery of domestic public officers.</p>
