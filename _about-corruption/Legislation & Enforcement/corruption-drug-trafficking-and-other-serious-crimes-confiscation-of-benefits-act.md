<p>The Corruption, Drug Trafficking and other Serious Crimes (Confiscation
of Benefits) Act 1992 (CDSA) provides for the confiscation of benefits
derived from, and to combat, corruption, drug dealing and other serious
crimes and for purposes connected therewith. The key feature of the CDSA
1992 is as follows:</p>
<h3><strong>Confiscation of Corrupt Proceeds</strong></h3>
<p>While the Prevention of Corruption Act 1960 punishes the corrupt offender,
the CDSA 1992 punishes offenders for the laundering of bribe money and
allows the state to confiscate corrupt benefits.</p>
