<p>A clean business protects a company and employees from being caught in
thorny and compromising situations. As part of the CPIB’s commitment to
combat corruption in the private sector, we have developed <strong><em>PACT: A Practical Anti-Corruption Guide for Businesses in Singapore</em></strong> to
help domestic business owners prevent corruption in their companies.</p>
<p>PACT provides useful facts on corruption in Singapore, an easily-implementable
anti-corruption framework, private sector case studies and other useful
anti-corruption resources.</p>
