<p>CPIB partnered with students from the Singapore Polytechnic Media, Arts
&amp; Design School, a journalist from The Straits Times and the Attorney-General’s
Chambers to co-create an educational book for teenagers entitled <em>The Corruption Casebook 2: Hidden Victims of Corruption</em>.
This resource aims to educate youth that corruption is not a victimless
crime and its pitfalls through vivid illustration of actual CPIB cases

<p><strong>The Corruption Casebook - Stories From Under The Table</strong>
</p>
<p>Corruption has far-reaching consequences in various aspects of society.
As part of CPIB’s prevention and outreach efforts, the CPIB has developed
an e-Book titled “<strong>The Corruption Casebook - Stories From Under The Table</strong>”
featuring stories on past cases of corruption. We hope it will be an interesting
and insightful read, especially for our youth who may not have encountered
corruption before.</p>
